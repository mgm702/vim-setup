**Things to still fix:**

- The next tab, past tab is kind of weird

- Add rails.vim

- Add easymotion.vim

- Look and see if any other plugins need to be installed from vim setup

- Autocomplete functionality does not always load on Insert

- Still need to try out avante.nvim and see what the hype is about

- Getting used to the nvim tree
