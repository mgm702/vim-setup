**Things to still fix:**

- The next tab, past tab is kind of weird

- Look and see if any other plugins need to be installed from vim setup

- Still need to try out avante.nvim and see what the hype is about

- Getting used to the nvim tree 

- Add the whitespace stripping on save

- add the following plugins:

-- emmet-ls
-- leap.nvim 
-- tmux.nvim
-- vim-bundler
-- rails.vim
